# tic-tac-toe


A tic-tac-toe turn based web game using PIXI.js and a Golang backend for server-side logic.

This is an experiment for learning Golang, Typescript and PIXI.js and primarily focuses on the back-end game logic.

Premise:

A more interesting turn-based revival of the original game.
Players have cards that can be their actions.
Player can only play 1 per turn (depending on context).
